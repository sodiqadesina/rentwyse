- Note that i have connected an online database so you have some data to work with

- Also you will need to put in an active email to confirm your account and you need internet connection running the backend because of the email service..

- I have restructured the files so the front end can make API calls

- I separated the port config into server.js and all other config about headers and route importation into the app.js file and connected them

- I added the route files and further broke down the app into routes and connected to the app.js file

- Also i added the middleware file and two middlewares check-auth and files middle-wares to handle route protection and to upload file from a create post call respectively

- added an images file to store images received form the newPost in the posts controller file

- still using bycrpt but passport.js isn't required anymore
