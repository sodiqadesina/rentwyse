- Created auth, error, header, posts, asset, environments and footer folders.

- In the Auth we handle user login and sign up

- In error we are handling error from the backend and displaying it on the screen

- In Post we are handling posts from the backend

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and make sure the backend is running on http://localhost:5500 or change in the environment.ts file

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
